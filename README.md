# ScriptTool
Script Tool is an automation tool.  It allows the user to create scripts in C# and run them from the main window or from the Script Tool icon in the system tray.

To load the Installer project you will need to have previously installed the Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 Installer Projects package.  If you don't have it, you can download it [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioProductTeam.MicrosoftVisualStudio2017InstallerProjects).

Scripts are currently run in a short-running task.  In the future, I may change this to a thread to allow for more complex scripts.

#### Thanks
A mighty thanks to these two guys. Without these two projects, ScriptTool wouldn't exist.
